FOSDEM and the microkernel developer room in particular was certainly one
of the highlights of the year. In this posting, I share my personal impression
of the event and a few links of interest.


For me, this year's FOSDEM was flying by as quickly as never before. The main
reason was my ambitious plan to present the *next* version of Sculpt OS
rather than the current one. When I originally submitted the talk, I was
planning to show off the by-then current version of Sculpt, which would
have been an easy feat. However, since then, there emerged a
[http://genodians.org/nfeske/2020-01-06-pending-sculpt-ui - concrete plan] for
reorganizing Sculpt's administrative user interface. The new concept would
embody the philosophy of Sculpt much better. Since the FOSDEM presentations
are captured on video, I figured that the video about Sculpt OS should better
not feature the old user interface but rather show the new one. The problem
was, however, that my vision of the new user interface existed merely in
my head but was not implemented yet. But motivation was strong! I literally
developed major parts of the user interface as shown in the demo - in
particular the file browser - in the train to FOSDEM, and the development and
testing work continued in the evenings until late at night. The intensive
work paid off as I could deliver the demo just as I intended.

The downside of this approach was my stress level, which largely kept me from
enjoying FOSDEM as a leisure activity. My head was spinning the whole time.


Microkernel developer room
--------------------------

Since initiated in 2011 by our friends of the
[http://www.helenos.org/ - HelenOS] project, the microkernel
devroom has become almost an institutional gathering of open-source projects
related to microkernel technology. It created a great sense of community and a
collaborative spirit among the various projects, which is the reason I look
forward to FOSDEM every year. In this spirit, the organization of the devroom
is carried out by a different project each year. This time, Julian Stecklina
took over the torch. Thanks Julian for the great work preparing and holding
the event!

Over the years, the devroom grew from a family meeting to a packed room of
about 100 people. Without any doubt, the reputation and the commercial
interest in the topics discussed in the room has grown quite significantly.
E.g., this year, tech celebrity Gernot Heiser made a
[https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/uk_sel4/ - physical presence],
and the traditional microkernel dinner turned into a reception sponsored by
the silicon valley startup [https://www.bedrocksystems.com/ - Bedrock].
The latter took many of the regular attendees - myself included - by surprise.

The
[https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/ - lineup]
of presentations was really worth staying in the room for the whole
day. But given the breath and depths of the audience and the lively
discussions in-between the talks, I got the feeling that I would have
experienced a great day even without a single presentation. ;-) Time rushed
by far too quickly. I missed catching up with so many fantastic people I
spotted in the audience.


Outside the developer room
--------------------------

On Saturday, I had the chance to wander around at FOSDEM for a bit.
Even though I vastly enjoyed the creative atmosphere of the event like
every year, I have to admit that the overcrowding made me uneasy. Hopping
between different venues is no longer viable because of the capacity limits
of most rooms.
There were still a few safe heavens though. In particular, I enjoyed staying
a while in the [https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/ada/ - Ada devroom]
and the spacey Janson auditorium, watching the
talk about [https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/blender/ - Blender] in
awe.


Genode at FOSDEM
----------------

On Saturday, Martin Stein presented his experimental
kernel named Spunky, which is a re-implementation of Genode's custom
kernel in Ada/SPARK:

On Sunday, I gave the live demonstration of Sculpt OS:

Stefan Kalkowski presented our
recent development of running Genode on 64-bit ARM platforms:

Alexander Senier gave an update about his effort to bring the Android
runtime to Genode:

Udo Steinberg introduced the NOVA microhypervisor for the 64-bit ARM
architecture, highlighting the fruitful collaboration of his team with
us at Genode Labs:

Further listening
-----------------

Only tangential related to FOSDEM but very well worth mentioning, there is a
new episode of the Syslog podcast. This episode covers the background of
Genode. Thanks to Julian and Florian for their invitation to have me on their
show!
