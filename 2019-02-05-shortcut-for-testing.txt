         A convenient shortcut for working with test packages


The train to FOSDEM was the perfect setting for creating a dirty little tool
for quickly building and running single test packages.

The previous Genode release introduced a new on-target test automation tool
called
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/18.11#Automated_test_infrastructure_hosted_on_top_of_Genode - depot autopilot].
[http://genodians.org/m-stein/index - Martin] converted more than 70 former
run scripts into packages that are readily deployable using this tool. This
dramatically cuts down the number of boot cycles and stresses the endurance of
the whole Genode system compared to the execution of only one test per boot
cycle.

Those benefits, however, come at the price of a little inconvenience when
dealing with an individual test. When instrumenting or extending, let's say,
the 'xml_node' test, one first has to create a package (using the depot/create
tool) along with the packages required by the depot-autopilot (like init,
report_rom, vfs, and fs_rom) before being able to execute the test. Even
though the depot-autopilot run script features a few nifty parameters to
enable a fairly efficient work flow, one still gets the feeling that the
packages stand in the way in such situations.

My little _test.run_ script found at
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode/commit/b892d4066bb1ca89f39de1a5743ad8e011ebeb43 - my topic branch]
attempts to regain the former convenience with dealing with low-level tests.
The basic idea is to feed the run script with a single 'PKG' argument with the
name of one test package. The run script looks up the matching pkg recipe
within the source tree and constructs a static system scenario out of the
information found in the pkg's runtime file. This information contains, for
example, the needed amount of RAM, the list of ROM modules required by the
test (listed in the '<contents>' node), the test configuration ('<config>'),
and a criterion for the success/failure of the test. Thanks to Martin's
herculean work with molding many of our tests into such runtime-description
files, those tests follow the same simple formalism now. This allows my
little _test.run_ script to extract all information needed for assembling a
static system. For example, the list of '<content>' found in the 'runtime'
file corresponds to the list of boot modules specified in the
'build_boot_image' step.

The second piece of the puzzle was the input for the 'build' step. This
information is absent from the test's pkg archive. Here, some brutal
heuristics come into play: The run script scans the source tree for all
'target.mk' files, in particular it looks for each target's name as defined in
via the 'TARGET' variable found in 'target.mk'. For each target name, the run
script now knows where in the source tree the corresponding 'target.mk'
resides. That is, it knows the 'build' argument needed to build a target with
a given name. But what are the names of the targets of the test scenario?
Well, the '<content>' definition of the test's runtime file includes all
targets the test relies on. Granted, it may contain also other ROM modules
such as libraries the targets depend on, but the targets are definitely in
there. So the run script simply tries to find a 'target.mk' file for each
'<content>' element. If there exists such a 'target.mk', it adds the target's
build path to the list of build arguments.

The last missing piece of the puzzle was the detection of the test's failure or
success. There are two typical mechanisms at play. First, a timeout indicates
that a test has failed. And second, a known-good log output confirms the
success of the test. Almost all low-level tests use this simple scheme. The
information for both mechanisms is present in the form of the runtime's
'<events>' node. The run script uses this information to feed the run tool's
'run_genode_until' function. It's funny that _test.run_ actually reverses
Martin's work when he turned the run scripts into packages. Martin turned the
formerly used regexp patterns to plain strings intermixed with wildcards and
applied quoting of special characters (like '<' and '>'). The _test.run_
script now converts these patterns back to regular expressions.

Test driving the test driver
----------------------------

To give the _test.run_ script a try, you may cherry-pick the commit cited
above (at my topic branch) and execute the following command from your build
directory:

! make run/test PKG=test-xml_node KERNEL=linux

It is quite surprising to me how many of the existing tests can be executed
this way out of the box. The tool is certainly not bullet-proof. You may call
it a hack. But that doesn't make it any less useful. ;-)

Thanks to Martin for pointing me to the '--xpath' feature of 'xmllint' and for
paving the ground for making tools like _test.run_ possible!
