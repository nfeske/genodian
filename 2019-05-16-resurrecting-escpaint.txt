              Resurrecting Escape Paint with Hatari


A recent series of events flared up my enthusiasm for Atari home computers.
I just couldn't help but draft a plan of bridging this nostalgic trip with
our modern-day Sculpt OS.

Before Genode was born, I dedicated my life to Atari computers, regarding the
wonderful people of the Atari demo scene as my second family.
[http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/~nf2/easter2002/easter2002.html - This] is
how my living room looked like back in the day. My entrance into the demo
scene was a paint program called Escape Paint, which I developed over multiple
years during the mid 90s for the Atari Falcon. Some years later, when real
life took over, I had to shelve my beloved Atari computers to make space
for kids stuff. Even though I kept following the Atari scene from a distance,
checking the odd news at the [https://dhs.nu - Dead Hackers Society], or
staring in awe at the fabulous
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTGnZTDUKd0 - marvels] released over the
years, my time was now consumed by the two projects family (three releases) and
Genode ([https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/releases - 42] releases).

Fast-forward to 2018, when I happened to review the shelved computers one
evening, my kids encountered those machines for the first time. CRT monitors.
Disk drives. The slick design of the computers built into those oversized
keyboards. SCSI cables, Joysticks of various shapes. Attraction. The
inevitable result was that my kids convinced my wife to dedicate a quarter of
our living room to Atari computers. This is how our family life looks like
now:

My son Dominik using the paint program that I created as a youngster 25 years
ago - that's the ultimate circle of a geek's life! I'm surprised how those
machines capture the interest of even modern-day children. The joy of
typing-in Basic programs
from the same books I had read, taking the Atari Profibuch as bed-reading
material, and designing player-missle spites on paper. Such a beautiful sight.
It goes without saying that these activities drew me in as well. There is
hardly a better way to spend a shitty-weather winter weekend than implementing
a Bresenham line algorithm in 6502 assembly using ATMAS-2.

In the intro, I spoke of a series of events. The infiltration of my family
with Atari was the first event.

A *second* event was Thothy's
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/retro_hatari/ - talk] at FOSDEM about
the Hatari emulator. There is still a thriving community around it, which is
fantastic! Looking around, another 32-bit Atari emulator/VM called ARAnyM put
out a massive [https://github.com/aranym/aranym/releases/ - release] just one
month ago.

A *third* event was is the release of former proprietary - but now abandoned -
software under open-source licenses or at least under public domain.
In particular, Andreas Kromke
[https://gitlab.com/AndreasK/Atari-Mac-MagiC-Sources - released]
the MagiC operating system - loved by so many including me - under GPL, and
the light-weight multi-tasking environment
[http://www4.pair.com/gribnif/downloads/geneva/ - Geneva] has become
available under public domain.
What's even better is that skilled developers like Thorsten Otto immediately
stepped up [https://github.com/th-otto/MagicMac - curating] the published
sources. Thanks to his work and documentation, I was able to compile MagiC
from scratch during the Easter weekend.
As these environments work nicely together with the free EmuTOS ROM image,
there is now a light-weight alternative to
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMint - FreeMiNT] for packaging and
distributing completely free disk images of Atari software.

A *fourth* event was an invitation to this year's
[http://dhs.nu/sommarhack/2019/ - Sommarhack]. I get to meet many of my idols
and friends in person again!

Inspired by these events, I developed the urge to run Atari software on top
of [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt OS]. Thanks to
Sculpt's deployment concept, it would be possible to deliver individual Atari
programs together with a ready configured emulator as one convenient
Sculpt package that can be installed just like an application, similar
to how we deploy Firefox on Sculpt using Alexander's
[http://genodians.org/alex-ab/2019-03-06-disposal-browser-vm - browser VMs].


The plan for Escape Paint as Sculpt OS component
------------------------------------------------

Genode's [https://genode.org/about/road-map - road map] for this year
puts emphasis on "Bridging Worlds". We seek to find smooth ways of porting
existing open-source software to Genode and deploy it within Sculpt OS.
Until now, we used to port 3rd-party software "manually" by writing custom
build description files for the Genode build system. It is obvious that this
approach does not scale. Since about one year, we experiment with the idea
of a
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/18.11#Initial_version_of_the_Genode_SDK - Genode SDK].
Instead of porting 3rd-party software into the Genode
build system, we would instead parametrize the software's original build
system to produce executable binaries that run on Genode. We actually
apply this approach for Noux packages (using autoconf) since a long time.
More recently, [http://genodians.org/ehmry/index - Emery] has generalized the
concept to non-Noux Genode components by facilitating 'pkgconfig'. I figured
that the port of Hatari to Genode would be a nice case for exercising the SDK.


Full stop! CMake ahead
----------------------

The Hatari build system uses CMake. Personally, I have never used CMake but
got the impression that many developers favour it today. For example, seL4
migrated to it. Also, Qt seems to go the route of eventually replacing their
custom QMake tools with CMake.

Now, with the porting of Hatari, I'm actually not "using"
CMake in the sense of writing 'CMakeLists.txt' files. Instead, I'm after
retargeting CMake to cross compile for Genode. My goal is to avoid any change
of the original Hatari source tree and build system. To my shock, I quickly
discovered that CMake is not just a tool but also a giant accumulation of
heuristics about libraries and compilers. Glancing at
'/usr/share/cmake-<version>/Modules/' certainly raised my eyebrows.
I had naively thought this is the job of pkgconfig these days.
Well, after thinking a bit more about it, this redundancy can probably not be
avoided as CMake ought to work on platforms where pkgconfig does not exist.
So there were two bad news for me. First, I cannot simply follow Emery's route
of using pkgconfig. CMake is simply another universe.
Second, I got to wade through those CMake modules files. Upon this
realization, I found it a good time to close the lid of my laptop.


Hack'n'Hike to the rescue
-------------------------

Genode's Hack'n'Hike is an annual gathering of Genode enthusiasts who spend an
enhanced weekend together at a nice place, hiking at daylight, and hacking on
fun projects at night time. When attending, it is always good to have a
faint plan for a hobby project to work on. This year, I successfully wetted
the appetite of [http://genodians.org/chelmuth/index - Christian] to join me
on a CMake discovery ride. We know that by connecting our brains together,
a tedious task can actually become a fun adventure using Club Mate and beer
for catalysis. Here is what we found:

* To prevent CMake from using its heuristics about the tool chains, we had to
  create a custom 'Modules/Platform/Genode.cmake' file and tell CMake to
  use it via the following command-line arguments:
  ! -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=$(PWD)/cmake/Modules
  ! -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Genode
  The first one tells CMake to look in our local path for modules.
  The second one tells CMake to include our custom tool-chain definition.
  Initially, we left this file blank.

* Our idea for supplying API headers to CMake was to use Genode's depot API
  archives as is. In the concrete case, we need the 'api/sdl' and 'api/libc'
  archives. Instead of using the latter directly, we conveniently used
  Emery's pkgconfig rules as follows (snipped from our custom Makefile):

  ! PKG_CONFIG_PATH := $(SDK_DIR)/pkgconfig
  ! PKG_CONFIG_CMD  := PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH) pkg-config
  !
  ! CFLAGS  := $(shell $(PKG_CONFIG_CMD) --cflags genode-posix)
  ! LDFLAGS := $(shell $(PKG_CONFIG_CMD) --libs genode-prg genode-sdl)

  Note that we cannot use 'genode-posix' together with 'genode-sdl' as both
  libraries take the role of implementing the 'Libc::Component::construct'
  function. The 'genode-sdl' pkgconfig rule did not exist. So we added
  one following the pattern of 'genode-posix' but referring to 'sdl.lib.so'
  instead.

  The LDFLAGS as returned by 'pkgconfig' already contain the right arguments
  for finding and using Genode's linker scripts.

* CMake uses the GCC frontend as linker. So we have to prefix the 'LDFLAGS'
  with '-Wl,':

  ! LINK_WRAPPER_ARG := -Wl,
  ! LDFLAGS := -nostdlib $(addprefix $(LINK_WRAPPER_ARG),$(LDFLAGS))

* To point CMake to the Genode tool chain, we used following command-line
  argument:

  ! -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(CROSS_DEV_PREFIX)gcc

  Here, 'CROSS_DEV_PREFIX' points to _/usr/local/genode-gcc/bin/genode-x86-_.

* To supply include and library search paths to CMake, the following
  command-line arguments become handy:

  ! -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH=$(API_INC_DIRS)
  ! -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LIB_DIRS)

  The 'API_INC_DIRS' is a colon-separated list of include paths. We can
  let them point directly into the corrsponding depot's api archives.
  For the 'LIB_DIRS' we cowardly specified the path to the _bin/x86_64/sdl_
  archive. This should better be replaced by pointing to an ABI stub library.

* CMake expects libraries be named after 'lib<name>.so' whereas Genode
  names libraries '<name>.lib.so'. Fortunately, this naming convention
  can be tweaked in the _Modules/Platform/genode.cmake_ file:

  ! set(CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES ".lib.so")
  ! set(CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES "")

  Cool, isn't it?

* The 'FindSDL' module of CMake implements heuristics for determining
  the SDL version. Those heuristics stumbled over our lower-case naming
  of 'sdl.lib.so'. Since there are no knobs to tweak the heuristics,
  we bended and changed our sdl/src archive such that a symlink 'SDL.lib.so'
  is created in addition to the 'sdl.lib.so' binary.

  Still, the SDL detection module did not work reliably. Finally, we found
  out that Hatari comes with a custom version of 'FindSDL'. So we were
  staring at the wrong place for quite some time. Ultimately, the following
  command-line argument convinced Hatari to use SDL version 1:

  ! -DENABLE_SDL2:BOOL=0

* Hatari happens to use a few double-float libm functions are we never
  needed before. So we have to up our game with Genode's libc.

  As we did not want to modify the libc just now, we replaced the function
  calls with their plain float counterparts in the Hatari source code. Of
  course, this is just a dirty quick hack.

It took us a while of digging in the CMake modules and sources to find those
hooks and overcome a few little stumbling blocks. But with the steps above,
CMake happily baked an Hatari executable binary for Genode!

For test-driving the binary, we just tweaked the sdl.run script in the
genode-world repository and added a '<start>' node for Hatari as follows:

! <start name="hatari">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="32M"/>
!   <config>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev">
!          <log/>
!          <inline name="rtc">2000-01-01 00:00</inline>
!       </dir>
!       <dir name="share"> <dir name="hatari">
!         <rom name="tos.img"/> </dir> </dir>
!       <tar name="escpaint.tar"/>
!     </vfs>
!     <libc stdout="/dev/log" rtc="/dev/rtc"/>
!
!     <arg value="hatari"/>
!     <arg value="--machine"/>      <arg value="falcon"/>
!     <arg value="--monitor"/>      <arg value="vga"/>
!     <arg value="-d"/>             <arg value="/ESCPAINT"/>
!     <arg value="-s"/>             <arg value="14"/>
!     <arg value="--timer-d"/>      <arg value="1"/>
!     <arg value="--fast-boot"/>    <arg value="1"/>
!     <arg value="--cpuclock"/>     <arg value="16"/>
!     <arg value="--confirm-quit"/> <arg value="0"/>
!     <arg value="--dsp"/>          <arg value="none"/>
!     <arg value="--statusbar"/>    <arg value="0"/>
!     <arg value="--zoom"/>         <arg value="2"/>
!     <arg value="--borders"/>      <arg value="0"/>
!   </config>
! </start>

The 'escpaint.tar' archive contains the files of an Atari system that
includes Geneva and Escape Paint. Geneva's 'GEM.CNF' contains a line
that starts Escape Paint automatically. So the system boots directly
into Escape Paint. The result running on Genode looks like this:

[image escpaint]

I'm super happy that the plan worked out so well. Thanks to Christian
for joining the CMake exploration. I wouldn't have expected this result
in just one evening.

Now, the outcome of this experiment is still not ready to real use. Apart
from minor details like extending Genode's libc with the missing libm
functions, Sculpt needs to provide a proper solution for capturing (and
releasing) the mouse pointer and for supplying relative mouse events to
the Hatari emulator. Right now, with only absolute pointer positions, Escape
Paint is a little awkward to use. But it works!

Besides Hatari, I plan to condense the reusable parts of the findings above
into a little CMake wrapper tool so that other CMake projects can be ported to
Genode more easily.
