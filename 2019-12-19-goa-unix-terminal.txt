           Goa - sticking together a little Unix (part 2)


Let us transcend the simplistic bash scenario created in
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2019-12-13-goa-unix-bash - part 1] and enter
the stage of an interactive system.


Some reorg is in order
----------------------

The scenario we built in the first part was quite small. For such small
scenarios, defining the <config> node right in the _runtime_ file is quite
handy. Once the subsystem becomes bigger, however, its better to move
the <config> into a dedicated ROM module. Let us create a new directory
named _raw/_ inside the project directory, and move the <config> node from
the _runtime_ file to a new file _raw/unix.config_. Goa will pick up all files
contained in the _raw/_ directory and supply them as ROM modules to the Genode
scenario.

Since there is no longer a <config> provided in the _runtime_ file, we tell
the runtime to use the "unix.config" as configuration by changing the <runtime>
node as follows:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init" config="unix.config">

Since _unix.config_ is expected to be present as a ROM module, we have
to declare via a <rom> node in the _runtime_ file.

For reference, the _pkg/unix/runtime_ file should now look as follows:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init" config="unix.config">
!
!   <content>
!     <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!     <rom label="vfs"/>
!     <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="fs_rom"/>
!     <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="unix.config"/>
!   </content>
!
! </runtime>

The _raw/unix.config_ file:

! <config verbose="yes">
!
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="RM"/>
!     <service name="CPU"/>
!     <service name="PD"/>
!     <service name="Timer"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!
!   <start name="vfs" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
!     <config>
!       <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
!       <default-policy root="/" />
!     </config>
!     <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
!   </start>
!
!   <start name="vfs_rom" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <binary name="fs_rom"/>
!     <provides> <service name="ROM"/> </provides>
!     <config/>
!     <route>
!       <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!       <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!
!   <start name="/bin/bash" caps="1000">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!     <config>
!       <libc stdin="/dev/null" stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"
!             rtc="/dev/null"/>
!       <vfs>
!         <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
!       </vfs>
!       <arg value="bash"/>
!       <arg value="-c"/>
!       <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/*"/>
!     </config>
!     <route>
!       <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!         <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!       <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!     </route>
!   </start>
!
! </config>

This reorganization has two advantages. First, we save one indentation
level for the <config> node. Second, by separating the _unix.config_ from
the _runtime_ in the form of a dedicated ROM module, we can later reuse
the same ROM module for other _runtime_ files. It is always good to have
reusable building blocks.

Let's give the new version a try by issuing 'goa run'. The output should
look familiar to us.


GUI stack
---------

Goa supports interactive system scenarios by looking at the requirements
stated in the _runtime_ file. Right now, the runtime file merely states
the amount of RAM and caps as a requirement. We can add the presence of
a GUI service as an additional requirement by adding the following
node inside the <runtime> node:

! <requires>
!   <nitpicker/>
!   <timer/>
! </requires>

When Goa processes the 'goa run' command, it evaluates this information.
The <nitpicker> node tells Goa that the scenario will request a so-called
"Nitpicker" session to a GUI server. When running the scenario on Linux,
Goa will automatically integrate the components needed for such a GUI server.
This includes a pseudo graphics driver, a pseudo input driver, and the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/os/src/server/nitpicker - nitpicker GUI server].

Let's try 'goa run' after having added the <requires> definition to our
_runtime_. We can see that Goa automatically downloads the basic components of
the GUI stack. Not only that. When starting the scenario, a new window
with a greenish background pops up. When hovering the mouse over the window,
you can see a small mouse pointer. If you are curious how the system the
GUI stack is assembled in detail, please have a look at _var/run/config_.
But from the perspective of our Unix scenario, these exact details are not
of interest. The only important point is that our scenario is now officially
able to request a "Nitpicker" and "Timer" service from the underlying
system.

With these preconditions in place, we can start a graphical terminal
in our _unix.config_ by adding the following two <start> nodes:

! <start name="nit_fb" caps="110">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!   <provides>
!      <service name="Framebuffer"/>
!      <service name="Input"/>
!   </provides>
!   <config/>
!   <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
! </start>
!
! <start name="terminal" caps="110">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="2M"/>
!   <provides> <service name="Terminal"/> </provides>
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label="config">
!       <parent label="terminal.config"/> </service>
!     <service name="Framebuffer"> <child name="nit_fb"/> </service>
!     <service name="Input">       <child name="nit_fb"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

The "nit_fb" component is an adapter. It requests a nitpicker session (routed
to the parent) and, in turn, provides the low-level "Input" and "Framebuffer"
services. The
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/gems/src/server/terminal - "terminal"]
uses these services to create a graphical terminal and provides the textual
input and output in the form of a "Terminal" service. In the routing rules of
the terminal, you can see that the terminal's configuration is fetched from a
dedicated ROM module called "terminal.config". We have no such ROM module
defined yet. However, let's still give it try:

! [init -> unix] Error: terminal: environment ROM session denied (label="terminal" ...)
! ...
! [init -> unix] Error: nit_fb: environment ROM session denied (label="nit_fb" ...)

That's not surprising as we have neither added 'nit_fb' and 'terminal' to our
_archives_ nor have we stated the <rom> modules in the runtime file's <content>.
Let's do this now. While we are at it, let's also add a <rom> node for the
"terminal.config" ROM.

The following two lines must be added to _pkg/unix/archives_

! nfeske/src/nit_fb
! nfeske/src/terminal

The following three lines must be added to the runtime file's <content>:

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="nit_fb"/>
!   <rom label="terminal"/>
!   <rom label="terminal.config"/>
! </content>

When trying 'goa run' again, we see that we exchanged the previous errors
with two new ones. Let's call it progress:

! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: Could not open ROM session for "config"
! ...
! [init -> unix] Warning: nit_fb: no route to service "Nitpicker"

The first error is easy to explain. We have configured the "terminal"
start node to fetch its configuration from a ROM called _terminal.config_
but have not defined the ROM module so far. Let's add a new file
_raw/terminal.config_ with an empty <config> node:

! <config/>

The second error tells us that there is no way for "nit_fb" to reach a
"Nitpicker" service. Let's take a look at the <route> rules for this
component:

! <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>

This rule says that all service requests should directly go towards the
surrounding Genode system, towards the parent of the component tree.
However, in the <parent-provides> declaration at the beginning of the
init <config> a "Nitpicker" service is nowhere to be found. Hence, init
refuses to ask the outside world for a "Nitpicker" service on behalf of
its child nit_fb. Let us enhance the <parent-provides> node with an entry
for the nitpicker service:

! <parent-provides>
!   ...
!   <service name="Nitpicker"/>
! </parent-provides>

Now, when trying 'goa run' for the next time, we see that something has
changed. The formerly greenish background of the graphical window has
turned black. Good news! The black is the default background color of
the terminal. However, as so often, the good news are accompanied with
less good news, as seen in the log:

! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: Uncaught exception of type
!                            'Genode::Xml_node::Nonexistent_sub_node'
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Warning: abort called - thread: ep

Well, the terminal seems underwhelmed by us serving an empty <config/> as
configuration. It is time to become more specific. Let's change the
content of the _raw/terminal.config_ to something meaningful:

! <config>
!   <vfs>
!     <rom name="VeraMono.ttf"/>
!     <dir name="fonts">
!       <dir name="monospace">
!         <ttf name="regular" path="/VeraMono.ttf" size_px="16"/>
!       </dir>
!     </dir>
!   </vfs>
! </config>

Wait a minute. How is this a terminal configuration?

The terminal expects its font to be found at its local VFS at
_/fonts/monospace_. The font has the form of a pseudo file system that
provides the pixel data of the glyphs along with the font meta data as a bunch
of pseudo files. So here, we mount a TrueType font with the 'ttf' file-system
driver at _/fonts/monospace_. The font file is specified as 'path' attribute,
which refers to "/VeraMono.ttf". This file, in turn, is backed by a <rom>
session that requests the ROM module named "VeraMono.ttf".

With this configuration in place, the next attempt of 'goa run' yields a
quite predictable result:

! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: ROM-session creation failed (...)
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: Could not open ROM session for "VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: failed to create <rom> VFS node
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     name="VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: ROM-session creation failed (...)
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: Could not open ROM session for "vfs_ttf.lib.so"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error: failed to create <ttf> VFS node
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     name="regular"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     path="/VeraMono.ttf"
! [init -> unix -> terminal] Error:     size_px="16"

The terminal configuration referred to two ROM modules that we haven't yet
included into the scenario. The "VeraMono.ttf" is the TrueType font data we
tried to mount as <rom> node. The "vfs_ttf.lib.so" is the driver for the "ttf"
pseudo file system. It is requested by the VFS when the <ttf> is encountered.
The errors can be resolved by extending the _archives_ file and the _runtime_
file's <content> node accordingly.

The following lines must be added to _pkg/unix/archives_

! nfeske/raw/ttf-bitstream-vera-minimal
! nfeske/src/vfs_ttf

The following lines must be added to the <content> node in _pkg/unix/runtime_

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="VeraMono.ttf"/>
!   <rom label="vfs_ttf.lib.so"/>
! </content>

After these modifications, the next try of 'goa run' works without any error.
We see the black screen and the log output of '/bin/bash' looks as usual.


Connecting bash with the terminal
---------------------------------

With the current scenario, bash and the GUI stack are running peacefully
side by side but they do not interact with each other. To connect them,
we will do the following:

# Mount a terminal session to the VFS of the VFS server at /dev/terminal.

  This can be done by changing the content of the <start> node of the
  VFS server. As a reminder, this is how it looks so far:

  ! <config>
  !   <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
  !   <default-policy root="/" />
  ! </config>
  ! <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>

  We change it to the following:

  ! <config>
  !   <vfs>
  !     <tar name="bash.tar"/>
  !     <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
  !   </vfs>
  !   <default-policy root="/" />
  !   <policy label_prefix="/bin/bash" root="/" writeable="yes" />
  ! </config>
  ! <route>
  !   <service name="Terminal"> <child name="terminal"/> </service>
  !   <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
  ! </route>

  The <vfs> node gained the configuration of _/dev/terminal_. When the
  VFS encounters the <terminal> node upon initialization, it will request
  a session to a "Terminal" service.
  The added route tells init to route the terminal session
  towards the "terminal" component.
  The added <policy> node defines that a file-system client labeled as
  "/bin/bash" is allowed to access the entirety of the VFS in a writeable
  fashion.

# Mount the file system as provided by the VFS server into the VFS of the
  bash shell. This way, all files provided by the VFS server become
  visible in the file name space of bash. This can be done by extending
  the <vfs> of bash by adding an <fs/> node:

  ! <vfs>
  !   <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
  !   <fs/>
  ! </vfs>

  When the VFS of bash encounters the <fs/> node, it will request a session
  to a "File_system" service. To let this request reach the VFS server,
  we have to add a new entry to the <route> definition.

  ! <route>
  !   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
  !   ...
  ! </route>

To have a visible effect, let's redirect the output of the "echo" command
executed by bash to the pseudo file _/dev/terminal_. Change the bash
argument to the following (just appending the "> /dev/terminal"):

! <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/* > /dev/terminal"/>

Upon the next attempt of 'goa run', magic happens:

[image goa_bash_terminal]

We have just redirected the output of the bash command to our terminal, which
used our TrueType pseudo-file-system driver to render glyphs on a pixel buffer
that, in turn, was blitted by the nitpicker GUI server to screen. Could our
day become any better? Sure! How about interacting with bash directly?

Change the <libc> configuration of bash to the following:

! <libc stdin="/dev/terminal" stdout="/dev/terminal" stderr="/dev/terminal"
!       rtc="/dev/null"/>

This change wires up the standard input and output of bash with
_/dev/terminal_. Let's also drop the '-c' arguments from the bash <config> so
that bash will wait for a command typed in via stdin. The next 'goa run'
will greet us with a shell prompt where we can type in bash commands like
echo:

[image goa_bash_interactive]

Of course, we feel a sudden urge to also execute the 'ls' command.

[image goa_ls_command_not_found]

The 'ls' command is a separate Unix command that is not yet part of our
scenario. It is covered by the [https:2019-12-22-goa-unix-pipes - next episode...]
