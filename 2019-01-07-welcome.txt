             A new place for sharing Genode-related stories

Genodians.org presents ideas, announcements, experience stories, and tutorials
around Genode, written by people like you and me. Genode users and developers
are very welcome to join our tribe of authors!

After more than a decade of development, Genode still remains a fairly obscure
project to many casual observers. New information comes out in bursts, along
with the quarterly Genode releases. In-between the releases, the project life
at GitHub and Genode Labs is vivid but it remains largely out of view of the
public eye. With genodians.org, we want to remove the mystery cloak from the
project by sharing practical insights and experience stories in a casual way.

The postings are maintained by each author individually. The website merely
aggregates them at one easy-to-find place. The simplest way to become an
author is as follows:

# Create a new repository for your content at GitHub. Let's call it "genodian".

# Add the following content to your genodian repository:

  * An _author.txt_ file with information about you that will be displayed
    along with your articles.
  * A 128x128 PNG image called _author.png_ that depicts you or an avatar
    of you.
  * Your first posting in a file called _<YYYY-MM-DD>-<title>.txt_,
    for example
    ! 2019-01-01-new-year.txt

  All text files are written in [https://github.com/nfeske/gosh - GOSH] style,
  which is very similar to markdown. You may take
  [https://github.com/nfeske/genodian - my repository] as reference.

# Open a new issue at [https://github.com/genodelabs/genodians.org] proposing
  the inclusion of your genodian repository.

Please also consider the README file at
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genodians.org] for more details, general
rules, and an easy way to test-drive the appearance of your postings locally
on your machine.
