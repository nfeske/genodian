We maintain a collection of future project ideas on
[https://genode.org/about/challenges - a dedicated website].
Today, I reviewed and updated the topics. Let me present the ideas.


Native Open-Street-Maps (OSM) client
------------------------------------

When using Sculpt OS, we regularly need to spawn a fully fledged web
browser in a virtual machine for using OSM or Google maps. The goal
of this project would be a native component that makes maps functionality
directly available on Genode, alleviating the urge to reach for a SaaS
product. The work would include a review of existing OSM clients regarding
their feature sets and the feasibility of porting them to Genode.
Depending on the outcome of this review, an existing application could
be ported or a new component could be developed, e.g., leveraging Genode's
Qt support.


OpenJDK (updated)
-----------------

[http://openjdk.java.net/ - OpenJDK] is the reference implementation of the
Java programming language and hosts an enormous ecosystem of application
software.

Since
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/19.02#Showcase_of_a_Java-based_network_appliance - version 19.02], 
Genode features a port of OpenJDK that allows the use of Java for networking
applications.

The next step would be the creation of Genode-specific native classes that
bridge the gap between the Java world and Genode, in particular the glue
code to run graphical applications as clients of Genode's GUI server. Since
OpenJDK has been ported to numerous platforms (such as Haiku), there exists
a comforting number of implementations that can be taken as reference.


Genode on the Librem5 phone hardware
------------------------------------

Even though there exists a great variety of ARM-based SoCs, Genode
primarily focuses on the NXP i.MX family because it is - in contrast
to most SoCs in the consumer space - very liberal in terms of
good-quality public documentation and reference code, and it scales
from industrial to end-user-facing use cases (multi-media).

The [https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/ - Librem5] project - with its
mission to build a trustworthy mobile phone - has chosen the i.MX family as
the basis for their product for likely the same reasons that attract us.

To goal of this work is bringing Genode to the Librem5 hardware.
For the Librem5 project, Genode could pave the ground towards new use cases
like high-security markets where a regular Linux-based OS would not be
accepted. For the Genode community, the Librem5 hardware could become an
attractive mobile platform for everyday use, similar to how we developers
use our Genode-based [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt OS] on our
laptops.


Xlib compatibility
------------------

Developments like Wayland notwithstanding, most application software on
GNU/Linux systems is built on top of the Xlib programming interface.
However, only a few parts of this wide interface are actually used today.
I.e., modern applications generally deal with pixel buffers instead of
relying on graphical drawing primitives of the X protocol. Hence, it seems
feasible to reimplement the most important parts of the Xlib interface to
target Genode's native GUI interfaces (nitpicker) directly. This would
allow us to port popular application software to Sculpt OS without
changing the application code.


Bump-in-the-wire components for visualizing session interfaces
--------------------------------------------------------------

Genode's session interfaces bear the potential for monitoring and
visualizing their use by plugging a graphical application
in-between any two components. For example, by intercepting block
requests issued by a block-session client to a block-device driver,
such a bump-in-the-wire component could visualize
the access patterns of a block device. Similar ideas could be pursued for
other session interfaces, like the audio-out (sound visualization) or NIC
session (live visualization of network communication).

The visualization of system behavior would offer valuable insights,
e.g., new opportunities for optimization. But more importantly, they
would be extremely fun to play with.


Hardware-accelerated graphics for virtual machines
--------------------------------------------------

In
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/17.08#Hardware-accelerated_graphics_for_Intel_Gen-8_GPUs - Genode 17.08],
we introduced a GPU multiplexer for Intel Broadwell along with support
for Mesa-based 3D-accelerated applications.
While designing Genode's GPU-session interface, we also aimed at supporting
the hardware-accelerated graphics for Genode's virtual machine monitors like
VirtualBox or Seoul, but until now, we did not took the practical steps of
implementing a virtual GPU device model.

The goal of this project is the offering of a virtual GPU to a Linux guest
OS running on top of Genode's existing virtualization and driver
infrastructure.


Microkernelizing Linux (updated)
--------------------------------

Thanks to Genode's generic interfaces for I/O access as provided by core, all
Genode device drivers including drivers ported from Linux and gPXE can be
executed as user-level components on all supported microkernels. However, so
far, we have not enabled the use of these device drivers on Linux as base
platform. The goal of this project is the systematic replacement of in-kernel
Linux device drivers by Genode processes running in user space, effectively
reducing the Linux kernel to a runtime for Genode's core process. But moving
drivers to Genode processes is just the beginning. By employing further
Genode functionality such as its native GUI, lwIP, and Noux, many protocol
stacks can effectively be removed from the Linux kernel.

In 2018, Johannes Kliemann pursued this topic to a state where Genode
could be used as init process atop a customized Linux kernel.
[https://lists.genode.org/pipermail/users/2018-May/006066.html - His work]
included the execution of Genode's regular device drivers for VESA and
PS/2 as regular Genode components so that Genode's interactive demo
scenario ran happily on a laptop. At this time, however, only parts of
his results were merged into Genode's mainline.

The goal of this project is to follow up on Johannes' work, bring the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/pull/2829 - remaining parts] into
shape for the inclusion into Genode, and address outstanding topics, in
particular the handling of DMA by user-level device drivers. Further down
the road, it would be tempting to explore the use of
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp - seccomp] as sandboxing mechanism
for Genode on Linux and the improvement of the Linux-specific implementation
of Genode's object-capability model.
