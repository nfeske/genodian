                 Pine fun - Booting Genode on the Pinephone


Until now, my exploration of the Allwinner A64 SoC was mainly concerned with
the Pine-A64-LTS board, which offers developer conveniences like booting over
the network, or easily accessible reset and GPIO pins. Now, it's time to
switch gears by moving the development workflow over to the Pinephone.

In the [https://genodians.org/nfeske/2021-09-03-pine-fun-networking - previous episode],
we picked networking as a suitable topic to cover the principle steps needed
for transplanting a moderately complex device driver from the Linux kernel to
Genode.
However, our vision of a Genode-based mobile phone requires drivers for
device hardware that is not present on the Pine-A64-LTS board. I'm speaking
of the display, touch screen, and modem, among many other peripherals.
So the time is overdue to switch the development to the Pinephone hardware.


Booting from SD-card
--------------------

Unlike regular smartphones, the Pinephone is able to boot directly from
an SD card, which is the preferred way for trying out the various Linux-based
operating systems that exist for the phone. Both the Pine-A64-LTS board as
well as the Pinephone are supported by the official U-Boot boot loader.
We already went though the process of manually building and installing
U-Boot in an
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2020-12-10-pine-fun-warmup#The_U-Boot_boot_loader - earlier article].
In order to attain repeatable and robust development workflows, however, we
have to automate these steps.

The _first_ piece of the puzzle is an automated way of obtaining a known-to-work
version of U-Boot, which comprises the *downloading* (and potentially patching)
of the source code and its dependencies. In Genode, this step is covered by
the so-called _ports_ tool, which installs 3rd-party software according
to a port description. In the case at hand, the port description file is
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner/blob/master/ports/pine_uboot.port - ports/pine_uboot.port].
The port consists of two parts that are mandatory for building U-Boot for
the platform, namely U-Boot itself and the so-called ARM Trusted Firmware.
Each of both parts is obtained from a separate Git repository.

The _second_ part is the *compile-time configuration* and the actual *build*
process of U-Boot. Here, Genode's build system comes in. The build target
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner/blob/master/src/u-boot/pine/target.mk - u-boot/pine/target.mk]
conserves all the magic spells needed to bake a U-Boot binary that is known
to work well on the targeted board. From a Genode build directory, it can
be invoked via:

! build/arm_v8a$ make u-boot/pine BOARD=pinephone
! ...
! ...
! ...
!    CONVERT  SD-card image u-boot/pine/pinephone.img

Let me draw your attention to two interesting details of the _target.mk_ file.
It takes one of U-Boot's default configurations as starting point and merely
tweaks a few options in a declarative way:

! SUPPORTED_BOARDS := pine_a64lts pinephone
!
! UBOOT_DEFCONFIG(pine_a64lts) := pine64-lts_defconfig
! UBOOT_DEFCONFIG(pinephone)   := pinephone_defconfig
!
! ...
!
! # read boot config from SD-card
! UBOOT_OPTION(pinephone) += ENV_EXT4_INTERFACE="mmc"
! UBOOT_OPTION(pinephone) += ENV_EXT4_DEVICE_AND_PART="0:1"
! UBOOT_ENABLE_COMMON     += ENV_IS_IN_EXT4 CMD_EXT4_WRITE
! UBOOT_DISABLE_COMMON    += ENV_IS_IN_FAT

Those declarations are taken as input into U-Boot's '.config' file by the
rule '$(UBOOT_CONFIG_FILE)'. In contrast to merely supplying a blessed
'.config' file handcrafted once via 'make menuconfig', this approach nicely
conserves the purpose behind configuration choices. E.g., as seen in the
snippet above, we deliberately configure U-Boot for using EXT file-system
support instead of FAT.

Another noteworthy detail is the '$(SD_CARD_IMAGE_FILE)' rule, which
creates a ready-to-use SD-card image that hosts only the boot loader. The rule
documents the (fairly non-obvious) steps needed for partitioning and
formatting of an SD card image that is works out of the box without any manual
tweaking needed.

The _third_ piece of the puzzle is the automated creation of a bootable
SD-card image for any given Genode system scenario using Genode's *run tool*.
The solution comes in the form of the
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner/blob/master/tool/run/image/pine_uboot_sdcard - tool/run/image/pine_uboot_sdcard]
plugin, with crafts an SD-card image containing U-Boot, a U-Boot runtime
configuration, and a Genode system image. It can be activated by adding the
following line to the build directory's etc/build.conf file:

! RUN_OPT += --include image/pine_uboot_sdcard

When enabled, the execution of a run script results in a ready-to-use SD-card
image that can be written to an SD-card using the 'dd' command. For example:

! build/arm_v8a$ make run/log KERNEL=hw BOARD=pine_a64lts
! ...
! Created SD-card image file var/run/log.img (6901kiB)
! build/arm_v8a$ sudo dd if=var/run/log.img of=/dev/sdx bs=1M conv=fsync

_Of course '/dev/sdx' must be adjusted to the device of the SD-card._


Using fastboot with the Pinephone
---------------------------------

A development workflow based on juggling SD-cards is hardly satisfying. It is
also prone to wearing out the hardware. Since network boot is out of question
due to the lack of a network connector on the phone, we long for an
alternative way to load custom system images to the Pinephone.
Here, the so-called 'fastboot' mechanism enters the picture. If enabled in
U-Boot, the boot loader enters a fastboot mode that uses the USB OTG connector
for receiving a stream of bytes before issuing a boot command.

Using the u-boot/pine build target for 'BOARD=pinephone', the resulting
SD-card image has everything needed to use this mechanism.

# When booting this image, enter the boot prompt by hitting a key.

# To automatically enter fastboot mode when booting up, one can define
  the 'bootcmd' environment variable accordingly.

  ! setenv bootcmd fastboot usb 0

# The command executed after the data transfer is finished can be defined
  via the 'fastboot_bootcmd' environment variable.

  ! setenv fastboot_bootcmd bootm 0x42000800

# Furthermore, to shave off a few seconds from each test cycle, the
  customization of the 'bootdelay' environment variable may be considered.

  ! setenv bootdelay 0

# Finally, one has to make the changed environment variables permanent
  by saving the changed environment back to the SD card.

  ! saveenv

Upon the next boot, the Pinephone automatically enters the fastboot mode,
waiting for the transfer of an image file over USB. At this point, the boot
log happens to show the message "musb-hdrc: peripheral reset irq lost!".

At the host side, the following steps must be taken.

# Enable fastboot loading in Genode's run tool by adding the following
  lines to the _etc/build.conf_ file in the build directory.

  ! RUN_OPT += --include image/uboot
  ! RUN_OPT += --include load/fastboot

# Install the fastboot tools, e.g., the 'fastboot' Debian package.

# On Linux, we must allow a regular user (like us) to access the fastboot
  USB device. This can be achieved with a custom udev rule by adding
  a file _/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pinephone-fastboot.rules_ with the following
  content:
  ! SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1f3a", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

# When developing inside a Linux VM in top of Sculpt OS, it is useful to
  add the following lines to '/config/usb' to ease the assignment of
  the Pinephone's UART and fastboot devices to the virtual machine.

  !<usb>
  !  ...
  !  <policy label_suffix="fastboot"      vendor_id="0x1f3a" product_id="0x1010"/>
  !  <policy label_suffix="pinephoneuart" vendor_id="0x403"  product_id="0x6001"/>
  !</usb>

  This way, one can refer to those devices to the
  _/config/launcher/usb_devices_rom_ configuration, e.g., by adding the
  following two '<device>' nodes, VirtualBox is prompted to request the two
  USB sessions using the specified labels.

  !<inline>
  !  <device label="pinephoneart"/>
  !  <device label="fastboot"/>
  !</inline>

  Note that each reboot of the Pinephone results in a different 'fastboot' USB
  device each time. In the current version of Sculpt, one needs to manually
  trigger the re-request of the "fastboot" USB session be removing and
  subsequently adding the corresponding '<device>' node manually.

With these steps taken, Genode scenarios can be sent directly to the
Pinephone using fastboot. Executing the framebuffer test has become as
simple as

! build/arm_v8a$ make run/framebuffer_pinephone KERNEL=hw BOARD=pinephone

After rebooting the Pinephone and executing the command above, we are greeted
with colorful patterns on the Pinephone's display and various messages of
the framebuffer driver in Genode's log output.
