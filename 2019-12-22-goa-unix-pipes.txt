           Goa - sticking together a little Unix (part 3)


In the [https:2019-12-19-goa-unix-terminal - previous article],
we went from a first life sign of the bash shell to an interactive
scenario. Today, we spice up our little system with the magic potion of Unix,
namely the presence of a collection of useful utilities and a mechanism to
combine them. If someone asked me for one word condensing the essence of Unix,
it would be "pipe". Off we go, plumbing!


Adding GNU coreutils
--------------------

The fun with our interactive bash shell at the end of the previous article
came to a full stop once we tried the 'ls' command. The command - along with
most others we commonly associate with Unix - are actually little programs
that are spawned by the shell each time when used. When typing 'ls', bash
doesn't actually know the purpose of 'ls'. It merely looks up a program named
'ls' and executes it. The program 'ls', in turn, has the single purpose
of printing directory contents. When executed, it takes a look at the file
system, prints the gathered information, and exits. The 'ls' command together
with its friends 'cp', 'mkdir', 'sort', and many others are the Unix core
utilities. On a regular GNU/Linux system, they are provided by the
[https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html - GNU coreutils]
package.

The GNU coreutils package is readily available for Genode. We can add it
by appending the following line to our _pkg/unix/archives_ file:

! nfeske/src/coreutils

After adding this line, the next invocation of 'goa run' will download
the source code along with a ready-to-use binaries to _var/depot/_.
In particular, you can find the binary at
_var/depot/nfeske/bin/x86_64/coreutils/<version>/_.
Analogous to the bash package, described in the
[https:2019-12-13-goa-unix-bash - first article],
there is a single TAR archive containing all the files that comprise the
coreutils installation.

! $ tar tf var/depot/nfeske/bin/x86_64/coreutils/2019-11-18/coreutils.tar
! ./
! ./lib/
! ...
! ./share/
! ...
! ./bin/
! ./bin/uname
! ./bin/groups
! ./bin/dircolors
! ./bin/chcon
! ./bin/nproc
! ./bin/true
! ./bin/mv
! ...

We follow the same pattern as previously used for integrating the _bash.tar_
archive.

# Declaring the use of 'coreutils.tar' as ROM module in the _pkg/unix/runtime_
  file's <content> node:

  ! <content>
  !   ...
  !   <rom label="coreutils.tar"/>
  ! </content>

# Mounting the 'coreutils.tar' as file system into the VFS of the VFS server.
  The VFS server's <vfs> should now look as follows:

  ! <vfs>
  !   <tar name="bash.tar"/>
  !   <tar name="coreutils.tar"/>
  !   <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
  ! </vfs>

  As you can see, the VFS supports the mounting any number of file systems
  side by side as overlays, which is commonly known as
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_mount - union mounting].

Remember from the end of the previous article that our attempt to issue
'ls' resulted in the following message:

[image goa_ls_command_not_found]

Let's give 'goa run' another go now.

[image goa_ls_no_such_file]

Unlike before, bash has actually found the 'ls' binary on the file system. We
mounted 'coreutils.tar' into the VFS after all, which you can easily reaffirm
via 'cd bin; echo *'. However, bash still failed to spawn the 'ls' program.
Genode's log output reveals why:

! [init -> unix -> /bin/bash -> 1] Error: Could not open ROM session for "/bin/ls"
! [init -> unix -> /bin/bash -> 1] Warning: execve: executable binary inaccessible as ROM module

Remember from the [https:2019-12-13-goa-unix-bash - first article]
that we have to make a program's binary available as ROM module in order to
execute it. We have accomplished this via the 'fs_rom' server handing out
file-system content as ROM modules, and directing bash's request for the
"/bin/bash" ROM module to 'fs_rom'. To recap, we defined the <route> rules for
'bash' as follows:

! <route>
!   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
! </route>

There is no valid route for a ROM service and the label "/bin/ls" yet.
In principle, we could follow the pattern of the "/bin/bash" ROM.
On the other hand, with many binaries installed at _/bin/_, the approach
would become cumbersome. A better solution is adding a route that matches
the label prefix "/bin". Changing the <route> of "/bin/bash" as follows
does the trick (pay attention to the third <service> node).

! <route>
!   <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <service name="ROM" label_prefix="/bin">
!     <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!   <any-service> <parent/> <any-child/> </any-service>
! </route>

The next try of 'goa run' yields the following result:

[image goa_ls_working]

A look at _/bin/_ reveals the wealth of commands that have just become
available at our finger tips.

[image goa_ls_bin]


Plumbing pipes
--------------

Let us try to count'em via the 'wc -l' command ('wc -l' counts the number of
lines).

[image goa_pipe_error]

With our attempt of using a pipe, feeding the output of 'ls -1' via the '|'
symbol as input into 'wc -l', we seem to hit another brick wall.
But that one isn't too bad. Until now, we haven't yet configured the
C runtime of "/bin/bash" (and its child processes) for the use of a pipe
mechanism. We can do so by adding a 'pipe' attribute to the <libc> node:

! <libc stdin="/dev/terminal" stdout="/dev/terminal" stderr="/dev/terminal"
!       rtc="/dev/null" pipe="/dev/pipe"/>

But _/dev/pipe_ does not exist, you ask! Thanks for paying attention.
On traditional Unix systems, the pipe mechanism is provided by the kernel.
On Genode, we provide it via a pseudo file system that is shared by both
ends of the pipe. The path _/dev/pipe/_ is the location of this pseudo
file system. To make it easily available to all Unix processes, we have
to mount it into the VFS of the VFS server. As a reminder, the <vfs> of the
VFS server currently looks as follows.

! <vfs>
!   <tar name="bash.tar"/>
!   <tar name="coreutils.tar"/>
!   <dir name="dev"> <terminal/> </dir>
! </vfs>

With the addition of the pipe pseudo file system, we change the
'<dir name="dev">' node into this:

! <dir name="dev">
!   <terminal/>
!   <dir name="pipe"> <pipe/> </dir>
! </dir>

As usual after making such changes, the repeated use of 'goa run' guides us
forward:

! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: Could not open ROM session for "vfs_pipe.lib.so"
! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: failed to create <pipe> VFS node

I'm sure, you guess what comes next. Let's enhance _pkg/unix/archives_ with
the following line:

! nfeske/src/vfs_pipe

Also declare the "vfs_pipe.lib.so" ROM in our _pkg/unix/runtime_ file:

! <content>
!   ...
!   <rom label="vfs_pipe.lib.so"/>
! </content>

With these minor tweaks in place, 'goa run' starts up successfully again.
This time, our attempt to combine 'ls' with 'wc' works as intended!

[image goa_ls_wc]


Life is not complete without Vim
--------------------------------

To wrap up the Unix experience, let's add the Vim text editor to the scenario.
The process is rather straight forward and follows exactly the pattern of the
addition of coreutils. That is

# Add vim to _pkg/unix/archives_

  ! nfeske/src/vim

# Add the "vim.tar: ROM to _pkg/unix/runtime_

  ! <rom label="vim.tar"/>

# Mount "vim.tar" at the VFS server

  ! <tar name="vim.tar"/>

Another try of 'goa run' downloads the needed depot content and starts the
scenario. The attempt to start 'vim' results in an error message in the
Genode log:

! [init -> unix -> /bin/bash -> 1] Error: Could not open ROM session for "ncurses.lib.so"

Vim is the first Unix program that requires
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses - ncurses], which is a library for
interactive terminal applications. To make it available to our system,
add 'nfeske/src/ncurses' to _pkg/unix/archives_ and
'<rom label="ncurses.lib.so"/>' to _pkg/unix/runtime_.

The next test run looks much better. Vim starts up successfully but is not
entirely happy:

[image goa_vim_no_tmp]

Vim relies on the presence of a _/tmp/_ directory. We can satisfy it by
mounting a memory-backed <ram/> file system in our VFS server by adding
the following line to its <vfs> configuration:

! <dir name="tmp"> <ram/> </dir>

Upon the next test run, we are greeted with another error message:

[image goa_vim_no_sh]

For some tasks like file globbing, Vim spawns a shell as child process and
expects the shell being available as _/bin/sh_. This default can be overridden
via the 'SHELL' environment variable. We can set the 'SHELL' environment
variable to the value "bash" by adding the following line to <config> of the
"/bin/bash" <start> node:

! <env key="SHELL" value="bash"/>

Furthermore, we can tame Vim by overriding its default configuration.

Create a file _raw/vimrc_ with the following content:
!set noloadplugins
!set hls
!set nocompatible
!set laststatus=2
!set noswapfile
!set viminfo=

Add a <rom label="vimrc"/> node to the <content> of _pkg/unix/runtime_.

Mount the "vimrc" ROM as _/share/vim/vimrc_ file at the VFS server:

! <dir name="share"> <dir name="vim"> <rom name="vimrc"/> </dir> </dir>

Finally, we can make ncurses aware of the actual terminal protocol implemented
by Genode's graphical terminal by setting the environment variable 'TERM'.
This enables the use of colors in Vim. Add the following line to the <config>
of the "/bin/bash" <start> node:

! <env key="TERM" value="screen"/>

With these changes, we are greeted with the following screen when starting
'vim' from the bash shell in our little Unix environment:

[image goa_vim_working]

We have just crafted a little Unix out of Genode's generic building blocks.
The result allows us to work with the time-tested an loved Unix core
utilities, combine them with pipes, and edit files with the full
comfort of Vim. All that has become possible with less than 150 lines of XML:

! $ wc -l raw/unix.config raw/terminal.config pkg/unix/runtime
!   88 raw/unix.config
!   10 raw/terminal.config
!   29 pkg/unix/runtime
!  127 total


Outlook
-------

In the next episode, we will see how to publish the result as a Genode
package, ready to be deployed on Sculpt OS.
