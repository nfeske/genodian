                 First system image of mobile Sculpt OS


At FOSDEM 2023, I'm going to introduce the mobile version of Sculpt OS at the
"FOSS on mobile" developer room - the perfect opportunity to kick off a
first public field test.

My presentation will be on Saturday, February 4, at 13:40 in the room
UB4.136:

:Can Genode on the PinePhone question the notion of a smartphone?:

  [https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/genode_on_the_pinephone/]

Besides introducing the project, I plan to give a live demonstration.
Linked below you can find the system image as used for the demo.

  [https://genodians.org/nfeske/2023-01-05-mobile-user-interface - user interface]
* Voice calls and mobile-data connectivity
* On-target software installation and system update
* Device controls (battery, brightness, volume, mic, reset, shutdown)
* Installable software
  * Chromium-based Morph web browser
  * OpenGL test program using the GPU (glmark2)
  * Camera test, audio oscilloscope
  * Light-weight Unix-like system shell
* _Edit (April 2023): Wifi_


Installation
------------

# Download experimental SD-card images from here:

  [https://depot.genode.org/nfeske/image]

  _Edit (April 2023): an official PinePhone image for Sculpt OS 23.04 is_
  _now [https://depot.genode.org/genodelabs/image - available] as well._

  You can find the disk image in two forms, as compressed .img.xz file
  or contained in a .zip file.

  You may check the downloaded image's integrity with GnuPG using the
  accompanied .sig files and my
  [https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/tree/master/repos/gems/sculpt/depot/nfeske - public key].

# Copy the image to an SD-card

  On Unix-like systems, uncompress the downloaded .img.xz file and copy the
  resulting .img file to an SD-card.

  ! $ xz -d sculpt-pinephone-<version>.img.xz
  ! $ sudo dd if=sculpt-pinephone-<version>.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync

  _Replace '/dev/sdX' by the name of your_
  _SD-card device. You may check 'dmesg' for obtaining the device name._

# Boot the PinePhone with the SD-card inserted.
  After around 5 seconds, the user interface should appear.

# Extend the Genode partition to the full size of the SD card.
  The downloaded image contains a tiny partition merely capable to the hold the
  base system. We need to expand it to the SD-card's actual capacity to have
  room for applications and data.

  * Select the "Storage" section
  * Select the partition "1"
  * Select "Expand" and confirm the operation
  * After a up to 20 seconds, you should see the partition size changed to the
    SD-card's capacity

# Make the expanded partition the default using the "Default" button.

The concepts mirror the PC version of Sculpt OS. Please refer to the Sculpt OS
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-22-10 - documentation]
for more details.


Quick start
-----------

# *Toggle* between the base system and the user-defined runtime at
  any time by touching the *left screen edge*.

# Enable the modem in the "Phone" section of the GUI.

# Once the modem is powered up, the SIM PIN is requested.

# Once the phone is "ready", enable mobile-data connectivity in the
  "Network" section. While connecting, the status in the network
  section title displays "mobile ...". Once connected, the three little
  dots disappear and the device-local IP address of the modem is displayed
  below the buttons.

# To test-drive the installation of software, select the "nano3d" preset in the
  "Software" section. This will trigger the installation of the components
  required by this preset, as reflected by the "install ..." message
  in the section title. You can get more details about the progress
  in the "Status" tab. Once the installation is complete, touch the
  left screen border to toggle between the just installed scenario and
  the base system.

  Yes, you can control the spinning thing with your finger.

# Try out the other presets.


Presets
-------

:camera test:

  Shows the camera image, switching between the front and rear cameras
  every 10 seconds.

:empty:

  Resets the runtime to the initial state with no components present.

:gpu test:

  GLMark2 OpenGL demo using the GPU.

:morph browser:

  Web browser based on the Chromium engine and Qt5. It is hugely complex.
  Hence your patience is needed while downloading and extracting it.
  You may switch to the status tab to watch the progress.

  Upon startup, the browser loads a simple landing page from genode.org
  with several links to the world-wide web.

  The browser is configured such that no state is stored persistently
  by using the ram fs as location for the browser cache, cookies, and
  downloads. You can wipe this information using "Reset" button of the
  ram-fs component in the runtime graph.

:nano3d:

  A simple software-rendering demo.

:osci:

  An oscilloscope for the microphone input. You need to enable the
  microphone in the "Device" section to see anything interesting.

:system shell:

  A Unix-like command interface allowing you to access the inner life
  of Sculpt's config and report file systems using coreutils and ViM.
  You can find the Sculpt partition mounted at _/rw/_.


Feedback

Please leave your feedback on the
[https://genode.org/community/mailing-lists - Genode mailing list].


Commentary and caveats
----------------------

* When entering a wrong SIM PIN too often, the SIM card will request a PUK.
  *PUK handing is not covered* bu the user interface. To reset the SIM PIN,
  you will need to boot your favorite Linux variant for the PinePhone.

* The *battery percentage* value is *not* always *reliable*. It is the plain
  information received from the power-management chip without any sanitizing.
  Take it lightly.

* The *power-meter* information is updated every *10 seconds*. To see the
  effect of a change like modifying the brightness, wait a bit.

* The system-shell preset corresponds to the system shell in Sculpt OS.
  You can find the selected Sculpt partition mounted at _/rw/_,
  the config file system mounted at _/config/_ and the report file system
  mounted at _/report/_.

  You can use vim to inspect the *system log* at _/report/log_.

* The report-dump option combined with the system_clock-dummy option captures
  the entire state of the report file system (including the system log) to the
  root directory of the SD card.
  This allows you to inspect this *diagnostic information offline* by browsing
  the SD-card on a regular PC.

* To take *screen shots*, enable the screenshot option in the software section.
  While enabled, a red dot is presented at the upper left screen corner,
  which can be touched to capture the current screen into a .png file.
  The .png files are named after a pseudo date and stored at the root of
  the Genode partition. As of now, they can be retrieved only by accessing the
  SD-card offline.

* Resource-heavy websites can bring down the morph browser. You can restart
  it by using the "Restart" button.

* The "Storage" section of the user interface looks out of place.
  This is because it was taken as is from the PC version of Sculpt OS,
  which was not designed for touch devices. In upcoming revisions,
  this section will become touch friendlier and will offer a file browser.

* The "History" and "Contacts" tabs in the phone section are mere mock ups
  to illustrate where we are going. The features are not provided yet.

* Some usability deficiencies like the missing ability to toggle the
  touch-screen keyboard in the morph-browser preset or the lack of proper
  symbols on the touch-screen keyboard are quite obvious.
  These surface-level usability aspects will be improved over time.

* Should you unexpectedly observe the screen going black, you may have
  accidentally touched the left screen border that toggles the user between
  the base system and the runtime.

_(added in April 2023):_

* One can select "Wifi" in the network part of the GUI, select an access point
  and enter your passphrase, just like on the PC version of Sculpt. Since the
  passphrase is not saved, however, one has to enter it each time when
  connecting, or use the trick described below.

* _Starting with the official Sculpt OS 23.04 version,_
  _both 2 GiB and 3 GiB models are in principle supported. However, the 2 GiB_
  _variant received almost no testing so far. The morph and jitsi presets are_
  _not expected to work with only 2 GiB._

* _When playing videos on the web browser, the sound is somewhat distorted,_
  _like overdriven._

* The jitsi preset starts a pre-configured Morph browser right into Jitsi
  alongside the camera driver. The camera is operated in gray scale because we
  found the colors provided by the sensor not really presentable. Later, we
  may come back to work on the colors but until then, gray-scale looks nice
  enough. When asked, select "Use Jitsi on the Website". As of now, the preset
  is mainly intended to ease the testing of further performance optimizations.
  It may not by suited for practical use yet.


A few tips for your experimentation
-----------------------------------

_(added in April 2023 for the Sculpt OS 23.04 release):_

As a life hack to avoid typing the same WPA passphrase again and again, we can
exploit the fact that the underpinning of the system is a regular Sculpt OS.
After connecting once to your wireless network, you can do the following:

# Switch to the system-shell preset

# Issue the following commands to the system shell

  ! mkdir -p /rw/config/23.04
  !cp /config/managed/wifi /rw/config/23.04/

Whenever Sculpt OS starts, the content of _/rw/config/23.04/_ is copied to _/config_ (see the
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-23-10#Making_customizations_permanent - documentation]).
Now, with the hard-defined wifi configuration, we join the
AP immediately when the wifi driver comes up. As a minor downside, the
interactive AP selection is no longer offered. To revive it, remove the
_/config/wifi_ file using the system shell.

Note that also all the other Sculpt OS tricks work. For example, when saving a
copy of _/config/managed/nic_router_ to /rw/config/23.04 while being connected
to wifi, you can hard-wire the selection of the network uplink to wifi,
sparing you the manual activation of wifi right after booting.

Or, as another nicety, if you always want to enjoy the nano3d preset right
after boot:

! cp /config/presets/nano3d /rw/config/23.04/deploy


Building the image from source
------------------------------

This flavor of Sculpt OS evolves in my
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode - nfeske/genode] and
[https://github.com/nfeske/genode-allwinner - nfeske/genode-allwinner] repositories,
specifically the respective 'pinephone' topic branches. Note that those
branches are not stable. Stabilized commits are routinely funneled upstream
to the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode - genodelabs/genode] and
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-allwinner - genodelabs/genode-allwinner]
repositories.

You can find further instructions in the README of the genode-allwinner
repository.

The system image can be built via the following command from within the Genode
build directory:

! build/arm_v8a$ make run/sculpt_image KERNEL=hw \
!                                      BOARD=pinephone \
!                                      SCULPT=phone \
!                                      DEPOT=omit

During iterative development, it is recommended to use the 'run/sculpt_test'
script using
