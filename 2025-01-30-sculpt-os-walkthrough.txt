                   A casual Sculpt OS walkthrough


As we recently got repeatedly asked for a screencast introducing the practical
use of Sculpt OS, I have now recorded a guided tour through the
installation, use, and customization of Sculpt OS version 24.10.

Even though [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt OS] has been in
routine daily use for years now, many outside observers still tend to perceive
it as fairly obscure because it does not follow the usual preconceptions of a
consumer-oriented operating system. Extensive
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-24-10 - documentation]
exists, but it leaves a fairly technical impression at a cursory glance,
which may scare some people away.

The screencast below aims at making the system a little bit more approachable.
It walks you through the steps of downloading, installing, booting the system
image, navigating the administrative user interface, and interactively
extending and customizing the system. The tour is wrapped up with the
steps for creating your personal sculpted OS on a bootable USB stick.
