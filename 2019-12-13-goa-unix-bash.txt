           Goa - sticking together a little Unix (part 1)


Whereas the [http://genodians.org/nfeske/2019-11-25-goa - first article] about
Goa was concerned with building software using commodity build systems, this
article takes you on a ride of creating a small Unix OS out of Genode's
ready-to-use building blocks, publishing the result, and deploying it on
top of Sculpt OS.

In the Goa introduction linked above, I already hinted at Goa's functionality
beyond the porting and building of software. This article shows the fun and
productive way of crafting component compositions out of Genode's readily
available building blocks. What could be a better example than building an
old-school operating system - Unix - that we all know and love?


Preparations
------------

Before continuing, please make sure to have installed the Goa tool, which
is available at [https://github.com/nfeske/goa]. If you have it installed
already, please make sure the tool is up to date. You can issue the following
command to update Goa to the latest version:

! goa update-goa


Hello bash
----------

As the first step, we want to get a life sign of the bash shell.
We start with a new Goa project appropriately named 'unix' that hosts
a runtime package but no source code.

! $ mkdir unix
! $ cd unix
! $ mkdir -p pkg/unix

Let's pretend we don't know what we are doing and create an _archives_
file with only bash listed, and an almost empty _runtime_ file.

The _pkg/unix/archives_ file:
! nfeske/src/bash

The _pkg/unix/runtime_ file:
! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init">
! </runtime>

Let's see what happens when issuing the 'run' command we know from the
previous article:

! $ goa run
! download nfeske/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2019-12-12.tar.xz

! Error: runtime lacks a configuration
!  
!  You may declare a 'config' attribute in the <runtime> node, or 
!  define a <config> node inside the <runtime> node.

We can see that Goa automatically downloaded bash along with its dependencies
such as the libc, and transitive dependencies such as Genode's base API.
Besides the binaries, it also fetches all source codes. You can find all the
downloads at _var/depot/_. One particularly interesting directory is the
binary archive for bash:

! $ ls var/depot/nfeske/bin/x86_64/bash/2019-11-25/
! bash.tar

It contains a single tar archive, which in turn, contains all installation
files of bash. Let's take a look inside:

! $ tar tf var/depot/nfeske/bin/x86_64/bash/2019-11-25/bash.tar
! ./
! ./share
! ./share/doc
! ...
! ./bin/bashbug
! ./bin/bash

Of course, the most interesting bit is the 'bash' executable at _bin/bash_.
When using the binary archive, the whole _bash.tar_ is supplemented to
Genode as a single ROM module. Let's add it to the <content> of the
_pkg/unix/runtime_:

! <runtime ram="100M" caps="5000" binary="init">
!   <content>
!     <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

After issuing 'goa run' again, you can find _bash.tar_ added to the _var/run/_
directory, which comprises all the ROM modules of our Genode system.

Of course, we cannot start a TAR archive. It is not an executable after
all. We rather need to access the content of the archive. Here, the
combination of three Genode components namely VFS, 'fs_rom', and init
comes to the rescue.

# The VFS server is able mount a TAR archive locally as a virtual file
  system and offer its content as a _file-system service_.

# The 'fs_rom' component provides a ROM service by fetching the content
  of ROM modules from a file system. By connecting the 'fs_rom' with the VFS
  component, the files of the _bash.tar_ archives become available as ROM
  modules. With the bash executable binary accessible, we can execute it.

# The init component allows us to stick components together and let the
  result appear to the surrounding system as a single component. We can
  use it to host the composition of the VFS, 'fs_rom', and bash.

Let's start with a fresh init that hosts only the VFS server by
placing the following <config> node inside the <runtime> node of the
_pkg/unix/runtime_ file:

! <config>
!   <parent-provides>
!     <service name="ROM"/>
!     <service name="LOG"/>
!     <service name="RM"/>
!     <service name="CPU"/>
!     <service name="PD"/>
!     <service name="Timer"/>
!   </parent-provides>
!
!   <start name="vfs" caps="100">
!     <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!     <provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
!     <config>
!       <vfs> <tar name="bash.tar"/> </vfs>
!       <default-policy root="/" />
!     </config>
!     <route> <any-service> <parent/> </any-service> </route>
!   </start>
!
! </config>

The <default-policy> expresses that any client should be able to access
the root of the virtual file system in a read-only fashion.

When trying to 'run' the scenario now, we see a bunch of error messages:

! $ goa run
! Genode 19.11-49-g11ba8b18fa <local changes>
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 8997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> unix] Error: vfs: environment ROM session denied ...

The messages tell us that init requested the ROM module 'vfs' that is not
available to the scenario, yet. To make it available, we have to
declare it in the _archives_ and as <content> in the _runtime_ file.
Let's add the following line to _pkg/unix/archive_:

! nfeske/src/vfs

Also make sure to have the ROM module listed as <content> in the
_pkg/unix/runtime_ so that it looks as follows:

! <content>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
! </content>

When issuing 'goa run' again, we can see Goa downloading the additional
components. On the attempt to start the scenario, we are confronted with
another error message:

! [init -> unix -> vfs] Error: Could not open ROM session for "vfs.lib.so"

This message tells us that the VFS server requests another ROM module, which
is a shared library. The _vfs.lib.so_ contains the actual implementation
of the virtual file system. It comes in the form of a library to enable its
use either locally by an individual application or via the VFS server. The
library is part of the 'nfeske/src/vfs' archive that is already listed in our
_archives_ file. So we can resolve this error by adding a corresponding <rom>
entry to the _runtime_ file. The <content> should now look as follows:

! <content>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
!   <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
! </content>

When running the scenario again, we see a sign of hope:

! goa run
! Genode 19.11-49-g11ba8b18fa <local changes>
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 8997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> unix -> vfs] tar archive 'bash.tar' local at ...

Yes! The VFS server is running and has successfully mounted the _bash.tar_
archive.

The second piece of the puzzle is the 'fs_rom' server, which can be added
to the <config> node with the following snippet:

! <start name="vfs_rom" caps="100">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!   <binary name="fs_rom"/>
!   <provides> <service name="ROM"/> </provides>
!   <config/>
!   <route>
!     <service name="File_system"> <child name="vfs"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

By using the <binary> node, we can label the component in a meaningful
way, calling it "vfs_rom". The first entry of the <route> node defines that
the request for a file-system session should be routed to the "vfs" component.

On the next attempt to issue 'goa run', we face an error message:

! [init -> unix] Error: vfs_rom: environment ROM session denied

By now, I'm sure you know how to resolve this one. Corresponding entries
to your _archives_ file and the _runtime_ file's <content> are added swiftly.
The fs_rom component gives us no life sign, which is normal. If you want to
get a little bit more action on screen, you may add the 'verbose="yes"'
attribute to init's <config> node. Another try of 'goa run' reveals the
following output.

! $ goa run
! Genode 19.11-49-g11ba8b18fa <local changes>
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 8997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> unix] parent provides
! [init -> unix]   service "ROM"
! [init -> unix]   service "LOG"
! [init -> unix]   service "RM"
! [init -> unix]   service "CPU"
! [init -> unix]   service "PD"
! [init -> unix]   service "Timer"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs"
! [init -> unix]   RAM quota:  9992K
! [init -> unix]   cap quota:  68
! [init -> unix]   ELF binary: vfs
! [init -> unix]   priority:   0
! [init -> unix]   provides service File_system
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom"
! [init -> unix]   RAM quota:  9992K
! [init -> unix]   cap quota:  68
! [init -> unix]   ELF binary: fs_rom
! [init -> unix]   priority:   0
! [init -> unix]   provides service ROM
! [init -> unix -> vfs] tar archive 'bash.tar' local at ...
! [init -> unix] child "vfs" announces service "File_system"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom" announces service "ROM"

That looks promising. Now with the bash executable available as ROM module,
let's give the bash shell a spin:

! <start name="/bin/bash" caps="1000">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!   <config>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev"> <null/> <log/> </dir>
!     </vfs>
!     <libc stdin="/dev/null" stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"
!           rtc="/dev/null"/>
!     <arg value="bash"/>
!     <arg value="-c"/>
!     <arg value="echo files at /dev: /dev/*"/>
!   </config>
!   <route>
!     <service name="ROM" label_last="/bin/bash">
!       <child name="vfs_rom"/> </service>
!     <any-service> <parent/> </any-service>
!   </route>
! </start>

The following parts are worth highlighting:

* The bash has its own VFS! This has nothing to do with the VFS server
  we started above. In fact, bash's VFS - as configured by the <vfs>
  node - merely contains the two pseudo files _/dev/null_ and _/dev/log_.
  The latter one is a LOG connection that enables the bash to write
  messages to the outside world.

* The <libc> node contains the configuration of the C runtime used by bash.
  Here we say how the standard output should go, or that the C runtime
  should obtain its "real-time-clock" information from _/dev/null_. No
  time for you this time!

* Via the sequence of <arg> nodes, we execute the command
  ! echo files at /dev: /dev/*
  It uses the shell's file globbing mechanism to obtain the list of files
  matching the pattern "/dev/*" and prints it via the 'echo' built-in command.

* The <route> rules explicitly tell init that the binary of the component
  should be obtained from the "vfs_rom" component.

When trying to 'goa run' the scenario now, we have to add a few more entries
to our _archives_ and <content>, specifically because bash uses the C runtime
(libc and libc) as well as the posix library. The full list of _archives_
now looks as follows:

! nfeske/src/bash
! nfeske/src/vfs
! nfeske/src/fs_rom
! nfeske/src/libc
! nfeske/src/posix

For reference, the <rom> modules listed in the _runtime_ file's <content>
node:

! <content>
!   <rom label="bash.tar"/>
!   <rom label="vfs"/>
!   <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="fs_rom"/>
!   <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!   <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
! </content>

Once these stumbling blocks are out of the way, 'goa run' greets us with the
following output:

! ...
! [init -> unix] Warning: /bin/bash: incomplete environment ROM session (/bin/bash)
! [init -> unix -> vfs] tar archive 'bash.tar' local at ...
! [init -> unix] child "vfs" announces service "File_system"
! [init -> unix] child "vfs_rom" announces service "ROM"
! [init -> unix -> /bin/bash] files at /dev: /dev/log /dev/null
! [init -> unix] child "/bin/bash" exited with exit value 0

The warning about the "incomplete environment ROM session" is nothing to
worry about. It stems from the fact that init is not able to obtain the
ROM module of bash's executable right away since the ROM is provided by
a service that was just started by init.

The message "files at /dev: /dev/log /dev/null"
is the output of bash command we have hoped for!

Granted, our scenario is still a far cry from being a Unix system.
In the next episode, we will add an interactive terminal.
