                    What's new in Sculpt OS 24.04

Sculpt OS 24.04 is packed. The spectrum of topics ranges from user experience,
over audio, USB, suspend/resume, on-target debugging, and goes on. In the
article, I'm presenting my personal highlights of this most profound release
so far, garnished with various bits and pieces of the updated documentation.

User experience
---------------

At Genode's [https://genode.org/about/road-map - roadmap], we declared "Sculpt
OS usability" as the main theme of this year. The release comes with long
anticipated improvements in that department. Its entirely new user interface
for managing components (the '+' menu) vastly reduces the amount of repetitive
user interactions. Preconfigured components can now be activated and stopped
using checkboxes, new software providers can be added on the fly, and the user
interface has become scrollable.

Seasoned Sculpt users will notice that device-device components have found
their proper place in the component graph now. One can not only see at a glance
which drivers were selected to drive the hardware of your machine, but
you can naturally find the management dialog for your NVMe storage at the
node of the 'nvme' driver. The same goes for USB and AHCI devices.

Audio
-----

[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.02#Revised_audio_infrastructure - Genode 24.02]
introduced a completely new audio stack, supporting pluggable drivers,
arbitrary sample rates, and the flexible routing of audio signals among
applications and drivers. Just in time for the release, all of Genode's
existing audio-supporting applications got adjusted to the new interfaces.
This includes VirtualBox, the Seoul VMM, the Falkon browser, and SDL-based
applications.
Sculpt OS 24.04 makes the new audio facilities conveniently available at the
options tab of the '+' menu. The central component is the mixer, which
provides the record and play services to the audio driver(s) and applications.

The audio driver is a mere client of the mixer. It can be started and removed
without interfering with the liveliness of audio applications.

[image sculpt_24_04_mixer_audio 40%]

By default, the mixer keeps the microphone muted and mixes the playback of all
applications at an equal volume. This policy is defined by the mixer's
configuration at _/config/launcher/mixer_, which you can find accompanied by
instructive comments. For example, uncomment the '<play>' nodes referring to
'mic_left' and 'mic_right' to unmute the mic, or tweak the volume values.
For tweaking the configuration, it is useful to know the labels of the
clients. One can obtain this information from the mixer's report at
_/report/runtime/mixer/state_.
You can find the mixer configuration described in more detail in its
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/blob/master/repos/os/src/server/record_play_mixer/README - documentation].

Analogously to the mixer, the audio driver can be configured dynamically
by tweaking the values in _/config/launcher/audio_. For example, you can
find the master volume for the whole device there.


Flexible assignment of USB devices to components
------------------------------------------------

Sculpt OS has built-in drivers for USB HID devices and USB storage devices,
which are started automatically if detected. In addition, individual USB
devices can be assigned to components such as virtual machines, webcam
drivers, or smartcard drivers. The user-defined rules for assigning USB
devices to components reside at _/config/usb_. Sculpt combines these rules
with dynamic built-in rules concerning HID and storage devices into
_/config/managed/usb_, which is the USB-driver configuration.

The _/config/usb_ file contains a few examples that can be taken as a blueprint.
The '<policy>' nodes refer to clients of the USB host controller whereas
the embedded '<device>' nodes represent assignments. The examples take the
vendor and device IDs of devices as keys for the assignment.

Note that one device may be present in multiple policies, which works well if
only one of the matching clients is running at a time. It is fine to define
rules for devices that are not present. As soon as such a device gets plugged
in, the assignment will take effect. This is useful when repeatedly plugging
and unplugging the same USB device assigned to a virtual machine.

While defining _/config/usb_ rules, it is helpful to review the currently
attached devices. This information is available at
_/report/runtime/usb/devices_.


System power control
--------------------

The new version offers system-power controls like reset, power-down, and standby
available as an optional feature. On PC hardware, this functionality requires
ACPI support, which can be enabled as option on the '+' menu.

[image sculpt_24_04_acpi_support 40%]

Once enabled, the "acpi support" component appears and the system menu at the
upper-left screen corner hosts interactive power controls.

[image sculpt_24_04_system_power 40%]

*Caveats*

As suggested by the names of controls, the reset and power-down operations
take immediate effect if confirmed. Note that the file-system driver
synchronizes file modifications every 10 seconds. So take a breath before
powering down or rebooting your machine.

The standby support is highly experimental. The baseline functionality of
returning from sleep to an interactively accessible system has been tested on
machines with mixed yet promising results.

On most machines, the wifi driver is not able to re-initialize the wifi device
after resume. The Lenovo x260 is a notable exception.

Upon resume, Sculpt OS restarts the USB host-controller driver, which
implies the restart of all USB clients. E.g., a virtual machine connected
to USB will be affected. While accessing any USB storage device, the standby
option is deliberately not presented.

The NVMe, AHCI, and Intel GPU drivers are suspend-resume aware, which means
that clients of their services are expected to continue operating after
resuming from standby. The response of the file-system stack to suspend-resume
cycles is not yet thoroughly tested through.

The audio driver is not automatically restarted during the suspend-resume
cycle. You may try restarting audio manually.

The limitations will be addressed gradually over time. Feedback about the
feature on your specific machine is appreciated. Don't hesitate to post your
experience on the Genode mailing list.


Touchpad on Intel Gen11+
------------------------

Touchpads on recent Intel laptops are integrated as I2C HID devices without
legacy PS/2 emulation. To support such touchpads, a dedicated driver is
needed. Even though Sculpt OS has no built-in touchpad driver, it offers
an I2C HID driver as an option in the '+' menu. Of course, you will need to
use a USB mouse to initially activate and configure this option.

The driver needs to know a few platform-specific values that must be manually
configured at _/config/launcher/trackpad_. The configuration is annotated with
known values for several laptop models. Adjust the configuration by using the
values matching your hardware and restart the touchpad driver to let the new
configuration take effect.


Tips for updating from Sculpt OS 23.11
--------------------------------------

Existing Sculpt OS installation can be updated to the new version using
the built-in system-update dialog. While moving your existing Sculpt
configurations to the new version, pay attention to the following changes:

* Driver components no longer carry the '_drv' suffix. If you have a
  custom nic-router configuration, you will need to adjust the labels of
  the policy nodes for the wifi and nic drivers.

* The event-filter policy nodes refer to drivers hosted in the runtime now.
  For adjusting the policy nodes, it is best to take the default rules
  at _/config/managed/event_filter_ as blueprint.

* The blank system-wide event service that allowed clients to submit
  unfiltered events to the GUI server is no more. Instead, events are
  always directed to the event filter. To accommodate components like a VNC
  server that need to inject events, you will have to add a matching
  event-filter policy.

* Block, USB, and GPU drivers are no longer provided by the base system
  but by the corresponding drivers hosted in the runtime. So you will have to
  adjust the routes of your block, USB, and GPU sessions.


What's not covered so far
-------------------------

This tour through Sculpt OS 24.04 ends here. But the list of exciting new
features goes on. For example, Sculpt just gained the ability of using GDB for
on-target debugging, including the full comfort of debug symbols! Or as
another example, the new goa-testbed preset allows developers to use Sculpt OS
as a remote test target for the Goa SDK. One click on the preset turns your
computer into a test machine ready for playing ball with Goa! These elaborate
topics certainly deserve dedicated articles. Keep an eye on genodians.org.
