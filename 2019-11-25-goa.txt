          Goa - streamlining the development of Genode applications


The development of applications for Genode used to require a lot of learning
about Genode's way of organizing source code, our custom build system,
and the use of run scripts. With Goa, I introduce a new tool that aims at
largely removing these burdens from application developers.

In contrast to the tools that come with Genode, which were designed for
developing complete systems, [https://github.com/nfeske/goa - Goa] is focused
on the development of individual applications. In a nutshell, it streamlines
the following tasks:

# The porting of 3rd-party software to Genode, which typically involves
  * Downloading 3rd-party source code via Git, Subversion, or in the
    form of archives,
  * Applying patches to the downloaded source code, and
  * Keeping track of changes locally made to the downloaded source code.

# Building software using standard build tools like CMake, alleviating
  the need to deal with Genode's custom build system.
  Goa takes care of automatically installing of the required Genode APIs
  and supplying the right parameters to the build system so that Genode
  executables are produced.

# Rapidly testing the software directly on the developer's Linux host system.
  Goa automatically downloads Genode components needed for the test
  scenario.

# Since Genode executables are binary-compatible between Linux and microkernels,
  the same software as just tested on Linux can be deployed on top of the
  other kernels. Goa takes care of exporting the software in the format
  expected by Genode's package management.

# Publishing (archiving and cryptographically signing) the software so that
  it becomes available to other Genode users, in particular users of Sculpt OS.


A first example, using a plain old Makefile
-------------------------------------------

Let's say, we want to build a hello-world application that uses the raw
Genode API with no libc whatsoever.

First, create a project directory, let's call it "hello":

! mkdir hello
! cd hello

By convention, the project name corresponds to the name of the directory.
Source codes are stored in a _src/_ sub directory. Let's create a
file at _src/hello.cc_ with the following content:

! #include <base/log.h>
! #include <base/component.h>
!
! void Component::construct(Genode::Env &)
! {
!   Genode::log("Hello");
! }

Besides the _hello.cc_ file, let's create a _Makefile_ at _src/Makefile_ with
the following content:

! hello: hello.cc

Now, let's give 'goa' a first try:

! hello$ goa build

This command prompts Goa to create a new directory called _var/_ within the
project directory. The _var/_ directory is the designated place for generated
files such as the build directory. However, upon the attempt to compile the
program, disaster strikes:

! hello.cc:1:10: fatal error: base/log.h: No such file or directory
!  #include <base/log.h>
!           ^~~~~~~~~~~~
! compilation terminated.
! make: *** [hello] Error 1
! [test:make] <builtin>: recipe for target 'hello' failed
! Error: build via make failed

Our program tries to include a header file that is nowhere to be found.
To resolve this problem, we can tell Goa that our project needs to use the
Genode base API, by placing a file named _used_apis_ with the following
content into the project directory.

! nfeske/api/base

This line tells Goa that our project depends on Genode's base API that
features the _base/log.h_ and _base/component.h_ headers. When issuing
the command 'goa build' again, we see the following message:

! download nfeske/api/base/2019-11-23.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/base/2019-11-23.tar.xz.sig

Goa automatically downloaded the base API for us and installed it into a fresh
depot at var/depot/nfeske/api/base/2019-11-23. But not only that, it also
re-attempted the build of the program. If we take a look at
_var/build/x86_64/_, we see the 'hello' executable. If the output was too
unspectacular for your taste, you may append the '--verbose' argument to the
'goa build' command to see more details about the steps taken.

To run the program, we need to tell Goa, which part of the build artifacts
are relevant to us. In our case, it's the 'hello' executable binary. We
can declare this information in a file called 'artifacts' with the following
content in the project directory.

! hello

If we issue the 'goa build' command again, we can see that this file
appears at _var/bin/x86_64/hello_. The content of the _bin_ directory
is meant for the integration into a Genode scenario.

Speaking of a Genode scenario, to run the program within a Genode system,
we have to define the "contract" between the program and the surrounding
system. This contract has the form of a runtime package. Let's create one
with the name "hello":

! hello$ mkdir -p pkg/hello

A runtime package needs at least two files, a README file and a _runtime_
file. The README file should give brief information about the purpose
of the Genode subsystem for human readers. The runtime file contains the
contractual information. Create a file _pkg/hello/runtime_ with the following
content:

! <runtime ram="1M" caps="100" binary="hello">
!   <content>
!     <rom label="hello"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

Here we declare the binary we want to start, how much RAM and capabilities
the subsystem expects and the content of the package. In this case, we
only have a single ROM module called "hello", which is our binary.

For running the scenario, we can use the 'goa run' command:

! hello$ goa run
! download nfeske/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2019-11-25.tar.xz
! download nfeske/bin/x86_64/base-linux/2019-11-25.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/bin/x86_64/init/2019-11-23.tar.xz
! download nfeske/bin/x86_64/init/2019-11-23.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/src/base-linux/2019-11-25.tar.xz
! download nfeske/src/base-linux/2019-11-25.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/src/init/2019-11-23.tar.xz
! download nfeske/src/init/2019-11-23.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/api/os/2019-11-18.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/os/2019-11-18.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/api/report_session/2019-02-25.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/report_session/2019-02-25.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/api/timer_session/2019-11-23.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/timer_session/2019-11-23.tar.xz.sig
! Genode 19.08-191-g951271a2b2 <local changes>
! 17592186044415 MiB RAM and 8997 caps assigned to init
! [init -> test] Hello

We can see that Goa automatically installed the dependencies needed to
execute the runtime package, integrates a Genode scenario, and executes
it directly on Linux. If you switch to another terminal, you can see
the Genode processes:

! $ ps a | grep Genode
!
! 8646 pts/3    Sl+    0:00 [Genode] init
! 8649 pts/3    Sl+    0:00 [Genode] init -> test
! 8650 pts/3    Sl+    0:02 [Genode] init -> timer

You can cancel the execution of the Genode scenario via Control-C.


A second example, using CMake
-----------------------------

As another step, let us create a new project that executes the 2nd step
of the excellent [https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/ - CMake tutorial].
Let's call the project "cmake_step2".
Instead of copying the code into the _cmake_step2/src/_ directory, let us
better tell Goa to download the code from the original tutorial. This can
be done by creating an _import_ file in the project directory. Create the
file _cmake_step2/import_ with the following content:

! LICENSE   := BSD
! VERSION   := master
! DOWNLOADS := cmake_step2.svn
!
! URL(cmake_step2) := https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/trunk/Help/guide/tutorial/Step2
! REV(cmake_step2) := HEAD
! DIR(cmake_step2) := src

This import file uses Github's SVN bridge to download only the specified sub
directory of the CMake project. Let's give it a try:

! cmake_step2$ goa import
! import  download https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/trunk/Help/guide/tutorial/Step2
! import  generate import.hash

After the command finished, we find the source code sitting nicely in a new
_src/_ directory. Let's try to build it:

! cmake_step2$ goa build
! [test:cmake] -- The C compiler identification is GNU 8.3.0
! [test:cmake] -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 8.3.0
! [test:cmake] -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/local/genode/tool/19.05/bin/genode-x86-gcc

! [test:cmake] Scanning dependencies of target Tutorial

! .../cmake_step2/src/tutorial.cxx:2:10: fatal error: cmath: No such file or directory
!  #include <cmath>
!           ^~~~~~~
! compilation terminated.

Apparently, the example requires the standard C++ library. We can supply
this API to the project by creating a _used_apis_ file with the following
content:

! nfeske/api/posix
! nfeske/api/libc
! nfeske/api/stdcxx
! nfeske/api/base

The 'posix' API is needed because - unlike a raw Genode component - the program
starts at a 'main' function. The libc is needed as a dependency of the
Standard C++ library.

When issuing the 'goa build' command again, we see that Goa downloads the
required APIs and successfully builds the example program:

! cmake_step2$ goa build
! download nfeske/api/base/2019-11-23.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/base/2019-11-23.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/api/libc/2019-11-18.tar.xz

! download nfeske/api/posix/2019-02-25.tar.xz.sig
! download nfeske/api/stdcxx/2019-11-18.tar.xz
! download nfeske/api/stdcxx/2019-11-18.tar.xz.sig
! [test:cmake] -- Configuring done
! [test:cmake] -- Generating done
! [test:cmake] -- Build files have been written to: .../cmake_step2/var/build/x86_64
! [test:cmake] [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/Tutorial.dir/tutorial.cxx.obj
! [test:cmake] [100%] Linking CXX executable Tutorial
! [test:cmake] [100%] Built target Tutorial

The resulting executable binary can be found at _var/build/x86_64/Tutorial_.
Let's declare it a build artifact by mentioning it a new 'artifacts' file with
the following content.

! Tutorial

To run the program, we need a runtime package that is slightly more advanced
than the first hello example. This time, we need declare that our runtime
requires content from other depot archives in addition to our program by
creating a file _pkg/cmake_step2/archives_ with the following content:

! nfeske/src/posix
! nfeske/src/libc
! nfeske/src/vfs
! nfeske/src/stdcxx

This way, our sub system incorporates the shared libraries found in those
depot archives. A suitable _pkg/cmake_step2/runtime_ for running the program
within a Genode scenario looks like this:

! <runtime ram="10M" caps="1000" binary="Tutorial">
!
!   <config>
!     <libc stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"/>
!     <vfs>
!       <dir name="dev">
!         <log/>
!       </dir>
!     </vfs>
!     <arg value="Tutorial"/>
!     <arg value="24"/>
!   </config>
!
!   <content>
!     <rom label="Tutorial"/>
!     <rom label="posix.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libc.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="libm.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="stdcxx.lib.so"/>
!     <rom label="vfs.lib.so"/>
!   </content>
! </runtime>

Since the tutorial uses the C runtime, we have to supply a configuration
that defines how the virtual file system of the component looks like, and
where the program's standard output should go. We also specify the first
and second arguments of the POSIX program as "Tutorial" (name of the program)
and "24" its actual argument. The '<content>' lists all ROM modules required.

With this runtime package in place, let's give the Tutorial a run:

! cmake_step2/$ goa run
! [test:cmake] -- Configuring done
! [test:cmake] -- Generating done
! [test:cmake] -- Build files have been written to: .../cmake_step2/var/build/x86_64

We see that Goa takes care of downloading all dependencies needed to
host the subsystem and subsequently executes the scenario. The program
built by the tutorial prints the result "The square root of 24 is 4.89898".


There is more to come...
------------------------

The intro above is just a part of the scope of Goa. I'll cover further
features - such as the publishing of Genode packages - in separate articles,
and improve Goa on the way, i.e., by adding support for other popular build
systems.

Please also feel welcome to explore Goa on your own. A good starting point
would be the built-in help command:

! goa help
