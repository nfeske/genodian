                    What's new in Sculpt OS 23.10


My personal highlights and a few technical tidbits about the just released
Sculpt OS version 23.10, putting the spotlight on the Framework laptop,
the PinePhone, and the MNT Reform laptop.

Following the somewhat formal
[https://genode.org/news/sculpt-os-release-23.10 - announcement] of the
release last week, I'd like to share a more personal take on the
new version.

The first personal highlight is the fact that we managed to deliver the new
version in a polished state simultaneously for three vastly different
platforms.

The machine on the left is my (slightly

[https://mntre.com - MNT Reform] open-source-hardware laptop, which
I greatly enjoy in the evening hours for various hobby projects.
In the center, you see the distinctive component graph of Sculpt OS
on the PinePhone.
On the right is a beefy Intel-based Framework Gen12 laptop, which serves
as my primary work horse.
Sculpt OS 23.10 improves the user experience on each of them. Before going
into details, however, let me point you to the official download page and
the updated documentation.

Framework laptop
################

Even though I have been routinely using Sculpt OS 23.04 on the Intel-Gen12
Framework laptop, I had to live with quite a few compromises. First, the
trackpad behaved quite erratically when using the PS/2 emulation provided by the
BIOS. Second, Genode's ACPICA component was incompatible with the Framework
hardware, rendering low-level platform details like the battery state
unavailable. Third, the Fn key of the keyboard apparently did not work, which
was quite inconvenient because some common keys like page-up/down are placed
on the Fn layer. The non-working Fn key also prevented me from controlling the
keyboard backlight. Fourth, whenever I put CPU-intensive load on the system,
noise of the fans would become obtrusive. After such a situation, the
fans kept spinning (at a low rate) even long after removing the load. The
power-management firmware on these modern machines seems to have a strange
inner life.

Sculpt 23.10 addresses those issues. After having solved the compatibility
problem of the ACPICA component, we were taken by surprise: Not only did
all the nice low-level platform features like battery state or
system-power-off become available, but the Fn key became fully functional as
well! On the new Sculpt version, I am using ACPICA in the form of the battery
(2023-10-19) component as provided by Alexander's (alex-ab) depot.

The Intel-Gen12 Framework laptop has an excessive amount of CPU cores.
There are six high-performance cores with each having two hyperthreads,
which are accompanied by 8 additional energy-efficient cores. At this
scale, Sculpt's ability to restrict components to only a portion of CPU
cores becomes handy. For example, when installing the Falkon web browser
from cproc's depot, here is how I define the browser's CPU affinity:

[image sculpt_23_10_affinity]

The right-most 2x2 cores are energy-efficient cores. By restricting
the browser to only those cores, a JavaScript-heavy website will hardly ever
get my fans spinning. Now comes the nicest part: By installing the
new interactive CPU-frequency tool provided by Alexander's depot,
we can monitor and control the power characteristics of all those CPUs.

The 20 cores are not just glorious to look at, but you can dynamically modify
the power profile of each, or all at once. Before I took the screenshot, I
started a YouTube video at full resolution. One can nicely see how the four
last cores have heated up to 61 degrees while the other cores are happily
chugging along at 10 degrees less.

Now being able to dynamically tune CPU-power parameters, I can easily push the
hardware to the maximum performance when needed, or calm the machine down to
fan-less operation. The sense of control is nothing short of satisfying.

As as remaining caveat when using Sculpt OS on the Framework,
the laptop has no physical mouse buttons. The left mouse button is
emulated by the trackpad. I remapped the right AltGr and Ctrl keys to
the middle and right mouse buttons by filtering the PS/2 input as follows:
! <remap>
!   <input name="ps2"/>
!   <key name="KEY_RIGHTALT"  to="BTN_MIDDLE"/>
!   <key name="KEY_RIGHTCTRL" to="BTN_RIGHT"/>
! </remap>
This looks a little bit like a hack. And it is. But it gets me through the day.
Down the road, we will equip Sculpt with a proper touchscreen driver,
eliminating the need for any PS/2 emulation. If you are eager to test-drive a
prototype, you can give the Sculpt image 2023-11-03 offered by chelmuth a try
and turn off the PS/2 emulation in the BIOS.


PinePhone
#########

Since the release of the first image for the PinePhone featuring our custom
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2023-01-05-mobile-user-interface - user interface],
we continuously improved the user experience according to the feedback of
early adopters. I'm especially grateful for the constructive comments received
in the [https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=14780 - Pine64 forum],
which led to a number of UI tweaks like the dialing of really long numbers,
or the use of '#' and '*' characters in phone numbers, or a sensible
reordering of UI elements.

The most technical user-experience improvement, however, is the addition of a
screensaver for conserving energy. The screensaver kicks in after a minute of
user inactivity in the administrative user interface. It also can be manually
activated by pressing the power button. While the screen is blanked, a press
of the power button enables the display again.

Under the hood, Sculpt completely removes the drivers for the display and the
touchscreen while the screen is blanked, which considerably reduces the power
draw. The system also switches the CPU to economic mode while the screen is
blanked. Here are some illustrative data points:

! Max brightness in performance mode: 2.8 W
! Max brightness in economic mode:    2.6 W
! Low brightness in economic mode:    1.7 W
! Screensaver:                        1.0 W

PinePhone users of Sculpt 23.04 can switch to the new version via the built-in
system-update dialog. New users can find ready-to-use disk images at the
Sculpt download page linked above.
Regarding the use of the system, let me refer you to my previous
[https://genodians.org/nfeske/2023-02-01-mobile-sculpt - article] as the
steps given there still apply.


MNT Reform
##########

Thanks to the work by [https://genodians.org/skalk/index - Stefan], Sculpt
OS 23.10 is readily available for the MNT Reform laptop. From an existing
installation of Sculpt 23.04, one can switch to the new version by selecting
the image 2023-10-24 offered by 'skalk' in the system-update dialog.

[image sculpt_23_10_update]

For preparing a new SD-card, you can download the image
[https://depot.genode.org/skalk/image/ - here].
Compared to the previous version, the user interface got more responsive,
downloads are much quicker now, and the Falkon web browser runs noticeably
faster.

The MNT-Reform image comes with custom presets curated by Stefan.
Thanks to these presets, one can install and use a web browser in just
few seconds or bring up a minimal desktop with a window manager as a starting
point for adding further components.
For the curious, Stefan also happens to provide a preset for running the Debian
installer in a VM. However, as he told me, this preset is merely an
experimentation ground today.
